### Positron Emission Tomography (PET) 
functionality is determined by geometric configuration of the imaging aperture among other set up parameters. 

The imaging energy source is [Positron Annihilation](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Particles/lepton.html#c5)in a radioactive sample. Detection of the radiation was performed using a pair of photomultiplier tubes facing directly opposing each other across the imaging track. To obtain multiple views of the sample, the sample imaging stage was rotated and scanned at a contiuum of angles and linear positions along track. 

The set up is shown diagramatically below:

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
